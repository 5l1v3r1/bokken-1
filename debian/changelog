bokken (1.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release (closes: #650076).
  * Main changes in this release are:
    - Full support for Radare2.  Now the opening dialog allows one to choose
      the engine.
    - Now you can open Java, mach0 and more ELF variants.  The rest of formats
      supported by radare2 are untested.
    - Disassembly has been enhanced: more precise, w/full dump of sections,
      symbols and more.
    - Several new tabs: Flowgraph, File info, Binary diffing, URL elements.
    - Enhanced support for web analysis.
    - Awesome code navigation à la HTML.
    - Crossed references and comments in code.
    - Interactive hexdump.
    - Advanced calculator.
    - x86 RCE cheat sheet.
    - Lots and lots of enhancements in the UI: from the general layout to
      polished details, the interface has taken a lot of work.
