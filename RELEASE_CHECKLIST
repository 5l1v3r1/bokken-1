Things to do in order to release Bokken
=======================================

(All the following examples are made with 1.5, please change it accordingly)

* Think that this will take quite some time.  Try to allocate the next two hours in your agenda.

* Start writing a blog post in http://ingumadev.blogspot.com.  Our blog posts have to be always accompanied
  by screenshots of the new features.  Review the existing images in Redmine and either replace
  them or add more to the wiki.

* Finish polishing details in Changelog and add release date.

* Change lib/bokken_globals.py and bump the global version accordingly.

* Debian packages:
  - Run dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -us and test it.

* Windows installer:
  - In a Windows environment with NSIS installed, clone the repository and run:
  cd install-scripts/
  createWindowsRelease.bat
  - This will create a bokken.exe that you will need to rename to bokken-1.5.exe.

* Tag the final release in mercurial:

hg tag -m "Tagged 1.5 release." 1.5
hg push
hg push git
hg push bb

* Make a tar.gz and zip archive with the following commands:

hg archive -X debian -X install-scripts -X glob:RELE* -X glob:.hg* -r 1.5 ../bokken-1.5.tar.gz
hg archive -X debian -X install-scripts -X glob:RELE* -X glob:.hg* -r 1.5 ../bokken-1.5.zip

and upload them with the Debian and Windows packages to Redmine as bokken-1.5.tar.gz (and so on) and
  under PROPER Version (1.5 in this case).

* Upload the Debian package to the right place in inguma.eu (/var/www/deb/pool/main/b/bokken) and run 'update_deb_repo'
  to update the Packages files and the rest of the Debian repository.

* Publish the blog post once you have the download links, with special attention to the published date (it will
  reflect when you started to write, possibly days ago).

* Based on the post and the Changelog, write a simple new News entry in http://bokken.eu/projects/bokken/news/new
  and refer to the blog article for further information.  See http://inguma.eu/news/6 as an example.

* Tweet about the new release and point to the blog post.

* Send a message to bokken-devel with the post/Changelog to spread the news.

* Go to Redmine, to the Versions tab under Settings (http://inguma.eu/projects/bokken/settings/versions) and
  open a new release (say 2.0) with a proposed release date.

* Go to the Roadmap page (http://inguma.eu/projects/bokken/roadmap) and move all the open bugs (if any!)
  in the already-released version to the next one.  You can do it in bulk from the UI.  Click on "X open bugs",
  and then select all of them (you can do it by clicking on a blank part in the first Subject field, then
  Shift-click in the last issue, and then right-click...Target version...2.0).

* Go back to the Roadmap page and move all the closed bugs in the Open Backlog (if any) into the
  already-released version.  Same as above, click "N closed", then select all and assign them to 1.5.

* Go to Redmine, to the Versions tab under Settings (http://inguma.eu/projects/bokken/settings/versions) and
  close the current version.

* Take a breath.
