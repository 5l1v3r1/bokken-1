Release 1.8 (10-06-2015)
 * Removed pyew entirely.  Its support has been in a non-official deprecated
   state for the past two years but we were trying not to do it.  Pyew has
   some dependencies that makes harder to package it, it's missing a lot of
   features from r2, plus it sees very few releases.
 * Removed other almost useless features in their current form: Strings repr
   and Interactive mode.  We expect to bring those at some point in a proper
   way.
 * Added r2 console.  It crashes here and there but we think it's rather
   usable.
 * Added interactive Python console.
 * Rearranged and simplified some tabs: Strings, Relocs and File info.
 * Some additional cleanups and fixes.

Release 1.7 (04-05-2015)

 * General refactoring of functions and classes to make them more abstract and
   generic.
 * Added new experimental web server (Mune) based on webpy with command-line
   flag --web.  It's very incomplete but the idea is to keep making it a
   first-class citizen in subsequent releases.
 * Fixed a lot of usability bugs, weird bugs, corner cases, unhandled
   exceptions and the like.
 * Revamped all the search dialogs, moved them to a new tab and fixed some
   bugs in the meantime.
 * Added compatibility with radare2 up to 0.9.8.
 * Added support for base address in radare.
 * Updated xdot to latest version.
 * Fixed Add comment functionality.
 * Added click-to-go and highlighting the search string.

Release 1.6 (23-01-2012)

 * Fixed vulnerability for symlink attack in /tmp (Debian bug #651931).
 * Replaced top menu bar with a button.  This will also ease integration of
   Bokken in Inguma.
 * Fixed some usability bugs that we found in the previous release.
 * Fixed some crashes both in Linux and Windows 7.
 * Made Bokken more stable when running in a system-wide installation like a
   standard Debian package.

Release 1.5 (07-12-2011)

 * Full support for Radare2.  Now the opening dialog allows one to choose
   the engine.
 * Now you can open Java, mach0 and more ELF variants.  The rest of formats
   supported by radare2 are untested.
 * Disassembly has been enhanced: more precise, w/full dump of sections,
   symbols and more.
 * Several new tabs: Flowgraph, File info, Binary diffing, URL elements.
 * Enhanced support for web analysis.
 * Awesome code navigation Ã  la HTML.
 * Crossed references and comments in code.
 * Interactive hexdump.
 * Advanced calculator.
 * x86 RCE cheat sheet.
 * Lots and lots of enhancements in the UI, from the general layout to
   polished details, the interface has taken a lot of work.
